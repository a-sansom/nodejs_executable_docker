    # Specifying a container_name stops ability to use more than one of a container at a time as each container needs to have a unique name.
    # As we're using the container 'as an executable', this is fine, we don't want more than one version of the 'executable'.

    # Mount a host (the Mac) filesystem path to a container path (which is used, for this example, as the WORKDIR in the Dockerfile).
    # This is being defined at this 'service' level, but can be defined at top level, for use across other services.
